## Introduction

Viade is an Application whose task is to manage routes.
<p>

</p>

It allows you to store your favourite scenic routes on your [Solid Pod](https://solid.inrupt.com/how-it-works) and to share it with your friends and family as well as comment on those of your friends'.

## To Start
### Create a POD

If you are not an owner of a POD you can create one by pressing the register button.
This will redirect you to a provider, where you can create your POD.

### Login

Once the POD is created, press the login button and a popup will ask you for credentials.
Once logged in you will have access to new options.

### Create a route

From "Route Management > Create a new Route" you can create a new route.
Just set a title, description, select the waypoints of the route and press "Save route in POD".

### View a route

We can now navigate to "Route Management > My Routes", where the routes you have created are listed.
When clicking on "Info" of the new route a new window will display all the information recorded, as well as comments posted and a elevation chart of the waypoints.

### Share with friends

When displaying all routes "Route Management > My Routes", you can click on the share option.
This will list all friends and when clicking share, a message with the route will be sent to the inbox of your friend.
