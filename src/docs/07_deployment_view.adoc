== Deployment View

Viade is multiplatform, so in the following lines we will show the physical architecture that our app will run over.

=== Infrastructure Level 1

| *Part* | *Explanation*

| Mobile Applications
| Android and iOS Applications will be generated and will run over such devices.

| Web Applications
| Main browsers will be able to run the application.

| Node.js
| Will be the runtime environment executing the javaScript code as server-side (not client-side).

| Solid PODs
| Will store the users information (their routes)
|===


Motivation::

It is a constraint that we must use Node.js, Solid PODs and be multiplatform so this structure is the result of that.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

=== Test Environment
Tests of the application are a relevant aspect of Viade.

|===
| *Test Framework* | *Explanation*

| Travis
| Thanks to Travis we can assure the continuous integration of Viade whenever a new feature is added. Travis takes care of running all the Jest tests as well as running code coverage revisions. Finally, if everything is correct, the application is built and updated.

| Jest-Dom Testing Library
| Tests whether the intended React components load correctly in the application.

| Code Coverage
| Checks for the amount of code that was run when performing the tests, useful to know precisely how deep the tests performed.

| Codacy
| Codacy checks for code quality. With it, we can easily create good quality code that follows the standards.

| Cucumber
| Helps with the simulation of the user's experience when using the app. It acts as if a user was using the application, and doing so, tests it for errors that may be present.

| POD in Docker
| As connection with the remote POD across the internet is not reliable, Docker can be configured to act as a server where a POD is stored. Doing so, the connection is ensured and all POD access tests can be performed risk-free.

Motivation::

Testing increases code quality and assures Viade's viability and security.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

Repairing errors and mistakes increases every aspect of quality.
All the testing will also ensure we understand where are the most used parts of the application and what should be optimised.
