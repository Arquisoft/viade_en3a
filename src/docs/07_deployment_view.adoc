== Deployment View

Viade is a client application, so we don't have multiple servers or a complex topology
to explain here. Therefore, this will be very simple.

=== Infrastructure Level 1

| *Part* | *Explanation*

| Internet Available APIs
| All the APIs we use are free, and online accesible.

| Viade App
| Our app will be deployed in GitHub Pages.

| Solid PODs
| They are allocated in Inrupt or Solid Community servers and maintained by them.
|===


Motivation::

* The use of Internet Available APIs is an advantage. Thanks to this
we don't have to store maps in our central server (which we don't have) nor in the client.
* Using GitHub pages avoids us to configure and mantain a server. All system administration is provided by GitHub.
* The use of Solid PODs is a constraint.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::

The mapping seems pretty clear. The "Viade Application" blackbox is the web displayed.
The interfaces shown are the ones we refer here and also the PODs.

=== Test Environment
Tests of the application are a relevant aspect of Viade.

|===
| *Test Framework* | *Explanation*

| Travis
| Thanks to Travis we can assure the continuous integration of Viade whenever a new feature is added. Travis takes care of running all the Jest tests as well as running code coverage revisions. Finally, if everything is correct, the application is built and updated.

| Jest-Dom Testing Library
| Tests whether the intended React components load correctly in the application.

| Code Coverage
| Checks for the amount of code that was run when performing the tests, useful to know precisely how deep the tests performed.

| Codacy
| Codacy checks for code quality. With it, we can easily create good quality code that follows the standards.

| Cucumber
| Helps with the simulation of the user's experience when using the app. It acts as if a user was using the application, and doing so, tests it for errors that may be present.

| POD in Docker
| As connection with the remote POD across the internet is not reliable, Docker can be configured to act as a server where a POD is stored. Doing so, the connection is ensured and all POD access tests can be performed risk-free.
|===


Motivation::

Testing increases code quality and assures Viade's viability and security.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

Repairing errors and mistakes increases every aspect of quality.
All the testing will also ensure we understand where are the most used parts of the application and what should be optimised.
