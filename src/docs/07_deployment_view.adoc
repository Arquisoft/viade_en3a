| *Part* | *Explanation*

| Mobile Applications
| Android and iOS Applications will be generated and will run over such devices.

| Web Applications
| Main browsers will be able to run the application.

| Node.js
| Will be the runtime environment executing the javaScript code as server-side (not client-side).

| Solid PODs
| Will store the users information (their routes)

Motivation::

It is a constraint that we must use Node.js, Solid PODs and be multiplatform so this structure is the result of that.
