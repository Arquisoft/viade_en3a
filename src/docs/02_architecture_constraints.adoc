== Architecture Constraints

Architectural constraints should be divided into three sections:
* Technical
* Organizational
* Conventions

Each one of them is broke into two parts: Constraint and a brief explanation of its existence.

.Technical Constraints
[cols="1,4"]
|===
| *Constraint* | *Explanation*

| JavaScript
| The programming language used for the most part of this project.

| React-native
| Combines the best parts of native development with React, it is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Reference: "https://facebook.github.io/react-native/"

| Git
| A distributed version control system.

| Node.js
| Node.js is a runtime system used mostly for making server side applications with JavaScript. Reference: "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js"

| SOLID
| Solid (derived from "social linked data") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and extensible and it relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols. Reference: "https://solid.mit.edu/"

| Docker
| Uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files. All containers are run by a single operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines. Reference: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)"

| Travis
| As a continuous integration platform, Travis CI supports your development process by automatically building and testing code changes, providing immediate feedback on the success of the change. Reference: "https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners/"

| CodeCov
| Codecov provides highly integrated tools to group, merge, archive, and compare coverage reports. Reference: "https://codecov.io/"

| Codacy
| Automatically identify issues through static code review analysis. Get notified on security issues, code coverage, code duplication, and code complexity in every commit and pull request, directly from your current workflow. Reference: "https://www.codacy.com/"

| Arc42
| Template for architecture communication and documentation. This technology will be the base of this project's documentation.

| Web access
| This project will allow users to use their services through a web interface.

| Smartphone access 
| This project will also be available for smartphone users.

| Browser agnostic
| It will not depend on any specific browser.

| Operating system agnostic
| Any OS will be able to use the products created in this project.

| Decentralized architecture
| The main aim is to create a decentralized structure supported with SOLID project and kind of social-media approach. Where everyone can interact with each other without everyone being connected at the same time.

| JSON format
| JavaScript Object Notation data format. Will be used in several parts of this project. For instance, while defining the dependencies of our code/builds.

.Organizational constraints
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| *Constraint* | *Explanation*

| The team
| Daniel Villanueva, David González, Jonás Martínez, Juan Sánchez-Ocaña.

| Time schedule
| Start in late January and deliver the final version in late May/June.

| Version control
| A Git repository keeps a complete commit history and the participation of the members of the team.

| Test tracking
| Track the different tests of the app with CodeCov or Coveralls. Aim to achieve a sufficient code coverage.

| Behaviour Driven Development
| Design the application encouraging the collaboration between developers and non-technical participants of the project.

| MIT License
| The project contents are open source and published under the MIT License.
|===

.Conventions
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| *Constraint* | *Explanation*

| Documentation
| Based in the arc42 template.

| Coding
| Use of the https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp[JavaScript coding conventions] and enforce them through Codacy.

| Language
| Code and documentation is developed in English for our international audience.

****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)
