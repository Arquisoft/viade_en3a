== Architecture Constraints

Architectural constraints are divided into three sections:
* Technical
* Organizational
* Conventions

Each one of them is broken into two parts: Constraint and a brief explanation of its existence.


.Technical Constraints

|===
| *Constraint* | *Explanation*

| JavaScript
| The programming language used for the most part of this project.

| React
| JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Reference: "https://reactjs.org/"

| Git
| A distributed version control system.

| Node.js
| Node.js is a runtime system used mostly for making server side applications with JavaScript. Reference: "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js"

| SOLID
| Solid (derived from "social linked data") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and extensible and it relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols. Reference: "https://solid.mit.edu/"

| Arc42
| Template for architecture communication and documentation. This technology will be the base of this project's documentation.

| Travis
| As a continuous integration platform, Travis CI supports your development process by automatically building and testing code changes, providing immediate feedback on the success of the change. Reference: "https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners/"

| CodeCov
| Codecov provides highly integrated tools to group, merge, archive, and compare coverage reports. Reference: "https://codecov.io/"

| Codacy
| Automatically identify issues through static code review analysis. Get notified on security issues, code coverage, code duplication, and code complexity in every commit and pull request, directly from your current workflow. Reference: "https://www.codacy.com/"

.Organizational constraints
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| *Constraint* | *Explanation*

| Working in a team
| Must work on a team of 6 people.

| Release dates
| The project has to meet the deadlines of the course.

| Version control
| Github has to be used for taking keeping track of the progress done on the project.

| Meetings control
| Minutes of all the team meetings that occur should be recorded and uploaded to the project wiki.

.Conventions
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| *Constraint* | *Explanation*

| Clean code
| The project follows clean code conventions so it is easier to maintain.

| Language
| This project has to be internationalized. For that we use react-i18next. Reference: "https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next"
