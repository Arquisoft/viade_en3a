== Architecture Constraints

Architectural constraints should be divided into three sections:
* Technical
* Organizational
* Conventions

Each one of them is broke into two parts: Constraint and a brief explanation of its existence.

.Technical Constraints

|===
| *Constraint* | *Explanation*

| JavaScript
| The programming language used for the most part of this project.

| React-native
| Combines the best parts of native development with React, it is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

| Git
| A version control system.

| Node.js
| Entorno en tiempo de ejecución multiplataforma, de código abierto, para la capa del servidor basado en el lenguaje de programación ECMAScript, asíncrono, con I/O de datos en una arquitectura orientada a eventos y basado en el motor V8 de Google.

| SOLID
| 

| Docker
|

| Travis
|

| CodeCov
|

| Codacy
|

| Arc42
|

| Web access
|

| Smartphone access 
|

| Browser agnostic
|

| Operating system agnostic
|

| Decentralized architecture
|

| JSON format

.Organizational constraints
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| *Constraint* | *Explanation*

| The team
| Daniel Villanueva, David González, Jonás Martínez, Juan Sánchez-Ocaña.

| Time schedule
| Start in late January and deliver the final version in late May/June.

| Version control
| A Git repository keeps a complete commit history and the participation of the members of the team.

| Test tracking
| Track the different tests of the app with CodeCov or Coveralls. Aim to achieve a sufficient code coverage.

| Behaviour Driven Development
| Design the application encouraging the collaboration between developers and non-technical participants of the project.

| MIT License
| The project contents are open source and published under the MIT License.

.Conventions
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| *Constraint* | *Explanation*

| Documentation
| Based in the arc42 template.

| Coding
| Use of the https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp[JavaScript coding conventions] and enforce them through Codacy.

| Language
| Code and documentation is developed in English for our international audience.

****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)
