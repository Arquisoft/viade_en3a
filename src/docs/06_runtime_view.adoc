=== Route Creation
image::RuntimeViewRouteCreation.png[RouteCreation]

The user creates a route using the map in the UI. Each time he creates a new point
a temporal object is created which stores name and description. Moreover, at creation
time or when it's position is updated, a real point is created (without name and description)
in order to ask the API for its altitude. This process is asynchronous and once we have the
response the elevation chart in the view is updated. Finally, when all the points are created,
the route is decorated with name and description for all the points. Then, it's uploaded to the POD.
