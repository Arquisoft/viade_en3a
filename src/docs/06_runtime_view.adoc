The user creates a route using the map in the UI. Once it presses save,
using the data it defined (name, description, route points), the route 
is created. In this point the altitude for each of the points is calculated
calling an external API. Once created the route is added to the list mantained
in the Route Manager. Asynchronously the new route is added to the POD.
