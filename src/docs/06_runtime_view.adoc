=== Route Creation

The user creates a route using the map in the UI. Each time he creates a new point
a temporal object is created which stores name and description. Moreover, at creation
time or when it's position is updated, a real point is created (without name and description)
in order to ask the API for its altitude. This process is asynchronous and once we have the
response the elevation chart in the view is updated. Finally, when all the points are created,
the route is decorated with name and description for all the points. Then, it's uploaded to the POD.


=== Route Listing

The process for listing routes is the following.

[arabic]
. The Route Manager gets cleaned in order to then load the new routes.
. A POD Storage Handler is created with the current user to gain access to the POD.
. The method getRoutes() starts an asynchronous route loading.
. For each of the routes retrieved we create a new one, and populate it with the data returned.
. The route is then added to the manager and printed in the screen for the user.
