|===
|Ref|Risk/Debt|Consequence| Suggested Solution
| 1 | New technology |A considerable technical debt in regard to the tecnologies proposed, as both SOLID and React are new to us, that might incapacitate us to obtain the desired result. | Read and obtain information beforehand to obtain the necessary information.
| 2 | Working as a team |A possible lack of coordination, due to our inexperience as a working group and differences as individuals.| Make use of tools like github issues and pull requests to improve as a team.
| 3 | Lack of time |Time management migth also be hard as we can not be 100% devoted to the project.| Organize our schedules and plan the work to be done in the minutes.
| 4 | Software conflicts |Incompatibilities in libraries and software used is also a risk that should be considered.| Check issues in the sofware before using it to prevent conflicts with what is already implemented.
| 5 | SOLID little maturity | Added to our technical debt, we have to take into account that SOLID is a new technology, so support and documentation of it might be scarce.|Share all the information found with our colleagues to share knowledge.
