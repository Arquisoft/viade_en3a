== System Scope and Context

The stakeholders of the application are described in the next lines and how the communicate. 

=== Business Context

User:: The user creates routes on our application or in other compatible aplications that use viadeSpec standard.
User Friends:: User SOLID friends can also create routes in their favourite application following the standard.
Applications:: Both applications will communicate between each other, showing and editing the routes or creating them. For an application to be considered compatible it must follow link:https://github.com/Arquisoft/viadeSpec[ViadeSpec].


=== Technical Context

==== Internally Controlled:

Application Front End:: 
	We use React to design it and Bootstrap to ease the design of the interface.
	It is our framework of choice for the frontend of the application, so this part will be developed in javascript and HTML.
	Its task is to build the HTMLs views which the user interacts with.

Application Back End::

RDFLib.js::
    It's a library used to communicate with the Pods (where the information is stored); to fetch and update data whenever necessary.

solid-file-client::
    A library used to store files in any format to the PODs.

solid-auth-client::
    A library used to authenticate a user securely and have access to parts of their PODs.

The application is based on the SOLID project for the re-decentralization of the web, therefore
each user is the owner of its own data through the mentioned Pods.

==== Externally Controlled:

On the above graph we show an example on how would the communication be when creating a route and being shown
in another compatible application. Information always goes through the POD, following the order marked by the numbers, and once there, compatible applications
will manage to show the routes in the way they do.

Although not depicted by the example, it can also be possible for both applications to swap roles and for our application to correctly display the routes the other application has created.
