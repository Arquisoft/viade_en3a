==== FrontEnd:

React:: 
	It is our framework of choice for the frontend of the application, so this part will be developed in javascript and HTML.
	Its task is to build the HTMLs views which the user interacts with.

==== BackEnd:

RDFLib.js::
    It's a library used to communicate with the Pods (where the information is stored); to fetch and update data whenever necessary.

solid-file-client::
    A library used to store files in any format to the PODs.

solid-auth-client::
    A library used to authenticate a user securely and have access to parts of their PODs.

The application is based on the SOLID project for the re-decentralization of the web, therefore
each user is the owner of its own data through the mentioned Pods.
